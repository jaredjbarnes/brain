Margins within text documents makes sense, however, within applications margins become difficult. Rules like margin-collapse become difficult to reason about. 

This is why layouts components like ZStack, HStack and VStack are so necessary. The components decide how the children components will display. Using Spacers instead of margins become a declarative way of keeping components visually separate.
