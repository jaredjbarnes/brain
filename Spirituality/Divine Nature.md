### Why & How
With every decision we make there is a why & how. The why is the motivation behind the act. Is it  extrinsic or is it intrinsic. Do we want glory, recognition, power, fame, or rewards? All of which are types of extrinsic motivators, or is it because the act itself brings us joy. If there is confusion as to whether or not the action was done extrinsically or intrinsically can be resolved with one question. 

#### "Was I attached to the outcome of the action?".

If we give a gift and its disregarded did we feel sad or disappointed? If we lost the basketball game did we feel shame. This allows us to truly reflect on our motivation. The goal would be to shift towards finding joy in the act itself that the outcome is irrelavant. People will justify extrinsic motivation as a path to become more disciplined or skillful. This is often how the pursuit of skillfulness starts, but rarely how it is sustained.
